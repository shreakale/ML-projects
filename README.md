Tasks Completed:
- Data Exploration & Cleaning: Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset, handled missing values, and dealt with outliers.
- Data Visualization: Created visualizations using `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` to analyze the distribution of data and relationships between variables.
- Model Development: Built and trained machine learning models, including Logistic Regression and Decision Trees, to predict customer outcomes.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
- Interpretation of Results: Interpreted model results to provide actionable insights for British Airways.



 üß† 2. Getting Started with Machine Learning  
This notebook demonstrates foundational data science concepts and workflow. It‚Äôs part of the hands-on experience for starting a career in data science with British Airways.
